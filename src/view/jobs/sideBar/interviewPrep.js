                <p className='es_font4 es_space'>Be succinct, honest and engaging.</p>
                <p className='es_font4 es_font3'>I call this the “SHE” formula. Resist the urge to give a detailed account of the last two decades of your career. The interviewer is looking for an answer that shows them you're qualified and can respond to an unstructured question.</p>
                <p className='es_font4 es_space'>Use the job description to prepare.</p>
                <p className='es_font4 es_font3'>Reread what they want and highlight the most required skills that you have. Are they looking for someone who can solve problems or deal with tough customers? Pick a few and brainstorm how you can describe yourself while showcasing your strengths for what they’re seeking.</p>
                <p className='es_font4 es_space'>Tie your story to their needs.</p>
                <p className='es_font4 es_font3'>People love a good tale, so weave in some personality. For example, maybe you fell in love with the hospitality industry because your grandparents ran a bed and breakfast. Connect your story back to the job, keep it short, and be truthful.</p>
